<!-- Generated from the README, variables and outputs of conn3xorg/circuit-users at v0.1.0. -->

A [Conn3x](https://conn3x.org) circuit that manages local accounts from one map: the users, the groups they belong to, and the SSH keys they log in with. A user can also get passwordless sudo, through a drop-in file in `/etc/sudoers.d`.

## Usage

```hcl
module "team" {
  source = "github.com/conn3xorg/circuit-users?ref=v0.1.0"

  hosts = {
    web1 = "203.0.113.10"
    web2 = "203.0.113.11"
  }

  ssh_private_key_file = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"

  users = {
    alice = {
      groups = ["developers"]
      keys   = [file("${path.module}/keys/alice.pub")]
      sudo   = true
    }
    bob = {
      groups = ["developers"]
      keys = [
        "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKcIIzM1rn1/TLenZvLoOhYMUDH09FQbF79aH8EBw8CM bob@laptop",
      ]
    }
    backup = {
      uid   = 990
      shell = "/usr/sbin/nologin"
    }
  }
}
```

Then run `conn3x init` and `conn3x apply`. A second `conn3x plan` says `No changes.` To try it on a throwaway container first, see [examples/local](https://github.com/conn3xorg/circuit-users/tree/v0.1.0/examples/local).

### Hosts with pinned host keys

A value in `hosts` can also be a host object, as in a circuit's own [`hosts`](/reference/circuits/hosts#host-object-fields). Use this to hand over servers created in the same plan, with the host key you gave them:

```hcl
module "team" {
  source = "github.com/conn3xorg/circuit-users?ref=v0.1.0"

  hosts = {
    for name, d in digitalocean_droplet.web : name => {
      address  = d.ipv4_address
      host_key = tls_private_key.host[name].public_key_openssh
    }
  }

  users = {
    alice = { keys = [file("${path.module}/keys/alice.pub")], sudo = true }
  }
}
```

A host object can set `address`, `user`, `port`, `private_key_file`, `host_key` and `jump_hosts`, and one map can mix addresses and host objects.

## What it does

On every host in `hosts`, in this order:

1. Creates every group that a user lists in `groups`. Groups that already exist, such as `wheel` or `sudo`, are left as they are.
2. Creates each user, or brings an existing one in line with the attributes you set.
3. Adds each key in `keys` to the user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Other keys in the file stay.
4. For each user with `sudo = true`, installs sudo and writes `/etc/sudoers.d/NAME`, mode `0440`, with the line `NAME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`.

Removing things from the map:

- **A key** is removed from `authorized_keys`, so a rotated key stops working.
- **`sudo = true`** turned off, or the user removed, deletes the user's sudoers file.
- **A user** is no longer managed, but the account stays on the host. Delete it by hand, or with a `user` step with `on_remove = "delete"`.
- **A group** that no user lists any more stays on the host.

Conn3x has no way yet to check a file with `visudo` before writing it. The sudoers line is built only from the user's name, and the `users` variable rejects names that aren't valid login names, so the file can't hold a syntax error.

## Inputs

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hosts` | map | Required | The hosts to configure. Each key is a host's name. Each value is its address, such as `"203.0.113.10"`, or a host object such as `{ address = "203.0.113.10", host_key = "ssh-ed25519 AAAA..." }`. |
| `users` | map(object) | Required | The accounts to manage, keyed by login name. At least one. See [users](#users). |
| `ssh_user` | string | `"root"` | The user to log in as. |
| `ssh_port` | number | `22` | The SSH port. |
| `ssh_private_key_file` | string | `null` | Path to a private key file. When null, Conn3x uses the keys in the SSH agent. |
| `ssh_known_hosts_file` | string | `null` | The known_hosts file to check host keys against. When null, Conn3x uses `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. Ignored for hosts with a `host_key`. |
| `ssh_become` | bool | `false` | Run every command as root through sudo. Set this when `ssh_user` isn't root. |

### users

Each entry's key is the login name. Every field is optional, so `{ carol = {} }` creates `carol` with a bash shell.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uid` | number | `null` | User ID. When null, the host picks one and Conn3x keeps it. |
| `shell` | string | `"/bin/bash"` | Login shell. |
| `home` | string | `null` | Home directory. When null, the host's default, usually `/home/NAME`. |
| `groups` | list(string) | `null` | Supplementary groups, as the complete list: the user is taken out of any group not in it. When null, the user's groups are left as they are. |
| `keys` | list(string) | `[]` | Public keys, in authorized_keys format, that can log in as the user. |
| `sudo` | bool | `false` | Let the user run any command as root through sudo, without a password. |

Login and group names start with a lowercase letter or `_`, followed by up to 31 lowercase letters, digits, `-` or `_`.

## Outputs

None.

## Requirements

- Conn3x v0.6.4 or later.
- Hosts running Rocky Linux, RHEL, AlmaLinux, Fedora, Debian or Ubuntu, with systemd.

## Tested on

Rocky Linux 10, Fedora 45, Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 13. CI applies [examples/local](https://github.com/conn3xorg/circuit-users/tree/v0.1.0/examples/local) to each on amd64 and checks that the second plan has no changes.
